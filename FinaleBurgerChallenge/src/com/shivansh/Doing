All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger
plus all additionals, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/final total for the
burger (base price + all additions)
For the two additional classes this may require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then
adding totals to final price.
